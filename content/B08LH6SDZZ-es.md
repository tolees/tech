ℹ️:

- 【4K Ultra HD & SONY Night Sensor】2 channels (Front and rear) or ONLY front recording, front camera captures 4K (3840 x 2160@30fps). The interior cabin cam uses the Sony IMX307 image sensor, giving it better night vision like qualities, making sure you can record passengers in low light conditions, so it’s a good feature to have for Uber Lyft, taxi and other rideshare drivers who want to record their passengers after dark.
- 【Heat Resistant & Professional Service】M550 will do well in high heat areas because it uses a Super Capacitor rather than a lithium batteries, which are build to survive extreme weather conditions from -4°F to 160°F. And it also gives a longer life-span than lithium-ion battery dashcams. AZDOME will provide ONE-Year warranty and fix your problem within 12 hours.
- 【WiFi App Control & GPS Tracking】Download the APP name AZDOME and connect the dash cam to your phone or tablet via WiFi, watch videos, see a live view and make settings changes in the menu. Built-in GPS tracks your vehicles location (latitude longitude), driving route and live speed of each journey by AZDOME Player.
- 【Parking Monitor & G-Sensor】M550 offers basic parking mode features. When you set it to parking mode when you’re away, it will stay in standby mode and automatically start recording if a major impact is detected, like a hit and run in a parking lot. If you use the parking mode feature you will want to have a hardwire kit that goes to your cars fuse box or an external battery.
- 【Three Channel Dash Cam】 M550 with the front camera recording video at 2K(2560x1440P@30fps) and the interior facing and rear back-up camera both shooting at 1920x1080P@30fps. The front facing camera has a lens angle of 160° to give you full coverage of the road in front of you, the interior camera has a 140° to capture the full inside of your car and the rear camera has a 140° lens angle as well.
